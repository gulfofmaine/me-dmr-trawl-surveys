Biological Data Excel File:
This file includes all data on maturity that were taken during the surveys. The species examined for age and maturity are decided before the survey. In this excel file you will find DMR_TRIP_IDENTIFIER (indicates the survey), DMR_EFFORT_ID (this is the tow number during that survey), REGION (1-5), STRATUM (1-4). The COMMON_NAME is the species, SAMPLE_LENGTH is the length of the species in cm and FREQUENCY is the number of times that length was examined (this shouldn’t be over 1, but I did find a frequency of 7 for an alewive, that is a mistake since we don’t examine alewives for age or maturity. It must have been entered in as a bio sample accidentally). The DMR_TRAWL_FISHID is our unique code for a species. DMR_SAMPLE_ID is a unique code for each sample. I wouldn’t use the AGE column since I haven’t gone and checked if those are ages entered after someone has aged the fish. SAMPLE_WEIGHT is the weight of the species in grams. GUT_FULLNESS is from when they have done stomach content in the past. If you do want to use that let me know and I’ll dig up some more information on it.
